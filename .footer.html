<p>
I've created these ports because:<br/>
 [1]&nbsp; there were no such applications in core/opt/contrib or<br/>
 [2]&nbsp; 'official' versions were build with/without some important options. (For example, I added "--enable-charset" to 
	mc and patched it for "on thy fly" recoding of the panel contents because I live in Ukraine and want to be able to read filenames and 
	their content in multiple codepages.)
<br/>
It is unlikely that you'll want my versions of official ports.
