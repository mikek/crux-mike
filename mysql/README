README for mysql 5.1.xx

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL
0. You might want to run post-install to create dedicated 
   mysql account (execute step 1 with sudo as the user which 
   will run mysql).
1. Run 'mysql_install_db' to build the system database in
   /srv/db/mysql
2. Start mysql server:
   /etc/rc.d/mysqld start
   Run 'mysql_upgrade' to add new privileges and features 
   to the MySQL privilege tables if you are upgrading from 4.x
   or 5.0.
3. To secure your installation change dir somewhere where your
   user has write access and run:
   /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

PRECAUTION
1. With the default configuration networking support for 
   mysql is disabled, meaning the mysql daemon is accessable 
   from localhost only. 
   To add networking support comment out the 'skip-networking' 
   line in /etc/my.cnf. 
2. If you upgrade from mysql 4.0.x you must recompile the 
   other packages on your system that are linked against the 
   mysql client libraries (libmysqlclient). 
   To obtain such a list of packages for your system, you 
   may use the command 'prt-get dependent mysql' or use yapo 
   to list the packages.

INNODB
  InnoDB table type support is compiled in but disabled by
  default. Comment out the skip-innodb line in /etc/my.cnf
  to fully enable InnoDB support.
