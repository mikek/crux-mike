README for slmodem

REQUIREMENTS
This port use alsa kernel drivers by default. Be sure to read README inside
package tarball for details.

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL
Create dialout group: "groupadd dialout". You might want to run 'depmod -a'
to make newly installed modules usable. Note, this is not a requirement for
alsa modem driver mode.

PRECAUTION
There is at least one catch you can fall in with alsa modem driver: before
actual dial sequence the 'Off-hook' mixer control (most likely for the second
sound card, representing modem) should be turned on explicitly, while the
'Phone' control of the main card should be set off after some timeout.

Some sample scripts follows.

modem_put.sh:
/usr/bin/amixer -c1 sset 'Off-hook' off
/usr/bin/amixer -c0 sset 'Phone' off

modem_take.sh:
/usr/bin/amixer -c1 sset 'Off-hook' on
/usr/bin/amixer -c0 sset 'Phone' on
sleep 35 && /usr/bin/amixer -c0 sset 'Phone' off

Sending ATD* strings:
modem_put.sh && 
modem_take.sh &
pppd ... ATD...
modem_put.sh
