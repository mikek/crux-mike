README for vsftpd 2.0.x

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL
Do not forget to adjust /etc/hosts.{allow,deny} as tcp_wrappers support is on.

POST-INSTALL
If you want to separate vsftpd privileges - run post-install (if not alredy
done).

RESOURCES

PRECAUTION
The anon_root is set to /srv/ftp/vsftpd in config file, vsftpd by default uses
'ftp' user for anonymous sessions (but we did not touch crux default 'ftp' user 
account with home=/var/ftp). Make relevant permissions changes to anon_root dir
or change vsftpd.conf yourself to allow anonymous uploads.
